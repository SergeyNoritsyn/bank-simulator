# bank-simulator
Program for storing and retrieving bank account information via user input.
The project is executed through the main file, which includes the Bank and BankAccount structs and uses them to interact with the user's input. The input is checked for
validity and requests for bank account access are verified for existence, eliminating typical bugs & methods to crash the security system. Pointers are used for storing 
user-created structs with individual attributes, including name, ID, and the stored amount of money.
